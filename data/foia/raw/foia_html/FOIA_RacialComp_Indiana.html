        <p>Dear Ms. Thomason:</p>

        <p>Pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public Records Act ยง 5-14-3-1 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that provide the demographic characteristics of your state level (SDIS) DNA database. Specifically, I am seeking a snapshot in time of: 1) the total number of DNA profiles held in the convicted offender and arrested offender databases; 2) the percentage or number of those profiles that belong to females versus males; 3) the percentage or number of those profiles that fall within specific racial and ethnic categories, in terms of the major racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Caucasian/White, African-American/Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.). I do not seek any personally identifying or individualized information; I only want an aggregate statistic. I also recognize that the composition of the database may change day-to-day, which is why I ask only for a recent snapshot at any moment in time (ideally within the last year). Finally, I prefer to receive the information according to the categories described (convicted offender and arrestee) but will accept data that combines those groups.</p>

        <p>If there are any fees for searching or providing these records, then I request a waiver of all fees for this request since the disclosure of the information I seek is not primarily in my commercial interest and is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, making the disclosure a matter of public interest.</p>

        <p>Should you deny my request, or any part of the request, please state in writing the basis for the denial, including the exact statutory citation authorizing the denial.</p>

        <p>I will contact your office to discuss when I may expect fulfillment of my request, and payment of any statutorily prescribed fees. If you have any questions in the interim, you may contact me at 212-998-6672 or <a href="mailto:erin.murphy@nyu.edu">erin.murphy@nyu.edu</a>.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <p>Erin Murphy</p>

        <p>Ms. Murphy,</p>

        <p>In response to your Public Records request concerning the demographic characteristics of the Indiana SDIS DNA database, the following are the responses to your request, in the most detail I could query in our system. While the DNA profiles themselves are labeled convicted offender versus arrestee, the database housing the other information you are seeking is not divided in that way so the percentages listed are for the combined categories. These statistics are as of today's date and are approximate. Race and Ethnicity are self-reported.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Total DNA Profiles:</strong><br>
                Convicted Offender profiles = 279,654<br>
                Arrestee profiles = 21,087
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Gender Distribution:</strong><br>
                Female = 20%<br>
                Male = 80%
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Racial/Ethnic Distribution:</strong><br>
                Caucasian = 70%<br>
                Black = 26%<br>
                Hispanic = 4%<br>
                All other categories are so small that together they represent less than 1%
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Respectfully,</p>
