    <p>Dear Professor of Law Erin Murphy:</p>

    <p>On June 13, 2018, the Nevada Department of Public Safety received your request for documents pursuant to Nevada's Public Records Law.</p>

    <div class="request-section">
        <p><strong>Records Requested:</strong> "Pursuant to the Nevada Open Records Act ยง 239 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that provide the demographic characteristics of your state level (SDIS) DNA database. Specifically, I am seeking a snapshot in time of: 1) the total number of DNA profiles held in the convicted offender and arrested offender databases; 2) the percentage or number of those profiles that belong to females versus males; 3) the percentage or number of those profiles that fall within specific racial and ethnic categories, in terms of the major racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Caucasian/White, African-American/Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.). I do not seek any personally identifying or individualized information; I only want an aggregate statistic. I also recognize that the composition of the database may change day-to-day, which is why I ask only for a recent snapshot at any moment in time (ideally within the last year). Finally, I prefer to receive the information according to the categories described (convicted offender and arrestee) but will accept data that combines those groups.</p>

        <p>If there are any fees for searching or providing these records, then I request a waiver of all fees for this request since the disclosure of the information I seek is not primarily in my commercial interest and is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, making the disclosure a matter of public interest.</p>

        <p>Should you deny my request, or any part of the request, please state in writing the basis for the denial, including the exact statutory citation authorizing the denial.</p>

        <p>I will contact your office to discuss when I may expect fulfillment of my request, and payment of any statutorily prescribed fees. If you have any questions in the interim, you may contact me at 212-998-6672 or <a href="mailto:erin.murphy@nyu.edu">erin.murphy@nyu.edu</a>.</p>

        <p>Thank you."</p>

        <p><strong>The Nevada Department of Public Safety has located the responsive information as follows:</strong></p>

        <p><em>It is almost impossible to get the DNA for just the last year because we do not store when the DNA was collected. The DNA lab does not provide us with that date nor do we have a location in the database to store that information. We only store if there is DNA on the individual. So, these are the totals in our entire Nevada criminal history record database. If you need anything else let me know.</em></p>
