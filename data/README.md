## 1. NDIS_time_series.csv

**Description:** Monthly time series of National DNA Index System (NDIS) statistics reconstructed from archived FBI webpages.

**Source:** FBI CODIS-NDIS Statistics pages, accessed via Internet Archive Wayback Machine  
**Temporal Coverage:** July 2001 - July 2025  
**Spatial Coverage:** 54 jurisdictions (50 states + DC + FBI Lab + US Army + Puerto Rico)  

### Column Definitions

| Column | Type | Description | Format/Units | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| `jurisdiction` | character | Name of reporting jurisdiction | Standardized state/territory names | Includes 50 states, DC, and federal entities (FBI Lab, US Army) |
| `year_month` | character | Report date from wayback machine timestamp (before 2007) and webpage "as of" statement (after 2007) | YYYY-MM-DD (first day of month) | Parsed from FBI webpage; distinct from capture date |
| `offender_profiles` | integer | Cumulative count of offender profiles in NDIS | Count | Includes convicted offenders; monotonically increasing |
| `arrestee` | integer | Cumulative count of arrestee profiles in NDIS | Count | Only available 2012+; NA for earlier periods |
| `forensic_profiles` | integer | Cumulative count of forensic (crime scene) profiles | Count | Monotonically increasing |
| `investigations_aided` | integer | Cumulative investigations aided by CODIS | Count | "Hits" that led to investigative leads |
| `ndis_labs` | integer | Number of participating NDIS laboratories | Count | Can increase or decrease as labs join/leave |

**Missing Data Patterns:**
- `arrestee`: NA for all records before 2012 (not collected)
- Some jurisdictions have intermittent reporting gaps

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Outliers and monotonicity violations detected have been flagged and corrected
- Original uncorrected data available in `intermediate/` folder

**Recommended Use:**
- Time series analysis of DNA database growth
- Jurisdictional comparisons over time
- Policy impact analysis (e.g., 2017 CODIS expansion to 20 loci)

| `value_type` | character | Type of value reported | "count", "percentage", "rate" | Units for `value` column |
| `value_source` | character | Provenance of value | "reported", "calculated" | Whether directly reported by agency or derived |

**Missing Data Patterns:**
- Only 7 of 50 states responded to FOIA requests
- Racial/ethnic categories vary by state (not standardized)
- Some states provided percentages only, others counts

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Categories reflect state agency terminology (not standardized across states)
- Some values are calculated from provided data (see `value_source`)
- Years of data collection vary by state
- This data represents demographic composition at time of FOIA response, not current

**Recommended Use:**
- Demographic disparity analysis
- Comparison with general population demographics
- Understanding variation in state reporting practices

- Racial/ethnic categories may not align perfectly across states due to reporting differences

**Recommended Use:**
- Comparative analysis of DNA collection rates across states and demographics
- Disparate impact analysis
- Policy framework comparisons
- Must account for varying data quality and estimation methods by state
