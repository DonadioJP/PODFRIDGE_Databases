    <h1>APPENDIX</h1>
    
    <p>The estimates reported in Part III.B at times relied, by necessity, on crude data. Although we strived for the most accurate information possible, at times we had to rely on proxies to make our estimates.</p>
    
    <p>Table 1 below reports the racial breakdown of Annual DNA collection for each state. It shows, for each state, the racial breakdown of the DNA collected annually, the racial demographics of each state based on the 2010 US Census, and for each race, the percentage of the population whose DNA is collected annually. The table shows that for most states, the percentage of non-White people whose DNA is collected annually is greater than that of White people. This is most evident for the Black population, which consistently showed the greatest levels of disparity.</p>

The first column shows the racial breakdown of the annual DNA collected by percentage and total count. Column 2 shows racial breakdown of the state population. Column 3 shows, for each race, the percentage of the population whose DNA is collected annually.</p>
    
    <p>In the text, we provide the general methodology and difficulties that we faced in compiling the data used for our findings. However, every state presented their own unique problems for us in coming up with our estimates. The following breaks down the laws of each state that triggers DNA collection, the sources we relied on for the data used, and the difficulties faced for each state. Note that every state's data collected is based on a single year as opposed to a total over a large span of time. Furthermore, the collection was performed in the summer of 2017, so the data used is what was most recent at that time.</p>
    
    <h2>Alabama</h2>
    <p>AL Code § 36-18-25 (2013) requires DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions, and from people arrested for all felonies and sexual offenses. For convictions, the data used was the prison admission data disclosed in the Department of Corrections Annual Report from 2014.<span class="footnote">1</span> The arrest data used was disclosed in the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Crime Report of 2014.<span class="footnote">2</span></p>

    <span class="footnote">2</span> http://alea.gov/documents/documents/CrimeInAlabama-2014.pdf</p>
    
    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> The lack of conviction data led to the use of prison admissions data. Specifically, there was neither disclosure of felony conviction data or sexual misdemeanor data. Second, the data was divided into only white and black, and thus, data concerning other races is unknown.</p>
    
    <h2>Alaska</h2>
    <p>AK Stat § 44.41.035 (2014) requires DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions, and from people arrested for all felonies and crimes against a person. For felony convictions, the data used was the total prison admission data for 2014 along with an estimate on the racial proportion based on the Prison Policy Initiatives data based on current prison population percentages.<span class="footnote">3</span> The sexual crime misdemeanor conviction data was estimated based on the disclosure of sex crimes reported in 2015 in Alaska.<span class="footnote">4</span> The data on arrests for felonies and crimes against a person was disclosed in a 2015 Crime in Alaska Annual Report.<span class="footnote">5</span></p>

    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> We were unable to find conviction data specifically and thus had to rely on prison admission data. Furthermore, the prison admission data found did not include the racial makeup of the admissions, thus requiring us to estimate based on the racial makeup of the current prison population. Lastly, the sex crimes disclosed by the state did not specify which of these crimes had led to convictions.</p>
    
    <h2>Arizona</h2>
    <p>AZ Rev Stat §13-610 (2016) requires DNA submission for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions, and for arrests for certain dangerous and serious offenses and for certain misdemeanors. For conviction data, we used the prison admission data from 2015, along with the racial makeup found the Prison Policy Initiatives data.<span class="footnote">6</span> The arrest data was found in the Crime in Arizona Report of 2014.<span class="footnote">7</span></p>

    <span class="footnote">7</span> https://www.azdps.gov/sites/default/files/media/Crime_In_Arizona_Report_2014.pdf p. 66</p>
    
    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> The lack of conviction data led to the use of prison admission data and an estimate on the racial makeup based on the current prison population. For the arrest data, the total arrestees were divided into different races, but were also separately divided into Hispanic and non-Hispanic categories. It is thus uncertain what the actual number of Latino Hispanics there are, as there could be other races that were also listed under Hispanic.</p>
    
    <h2>Arkansas</h2>
    <p>AR Code §12-12-1109 requires DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions. AR Code §12-12-1006 requires DNA submissions for those arrested for capital murder, first degree murder, kidnapping, rape, and first and second-degree sexual assault. For conviction data, prison admission and racial makeup data was used from 2015.<span class="footnote">8</span> The arrest data was provided by the state under a report on the race of persons arrested in 2015.<span class="footnote">9</span></p>

    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> Specific information on sexual misdemeanor convictions were not found. The prison admission data may not encompass those convictions as many may not lead to prison time. For arrest data, the racial makeup did not include Hispanics.</p>
    
    <h2>California</h2>
    <p>CA Penal Code §296 requires DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions and for any arrest for a felony. Data concerning felony convictions and felony arrests were found in the 2014 version of Crime in California.<span class="footnote">10</span> For felony convictions, the number provided in the report did not provide the racial makeup; thus, the prison population racial makeup from Prison Policy Initiative was used.</p>
    
    <p><span class="footnote">10</span> https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cjsc/publications/candd/cd14/cd14.pdf (p. 53 for convictions, p. 34 for arrests)</p>
    
    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> Data on sex crime misdemeanor convictions were not found. The racial makeup of convictions had to be estimated based on the current prison population. For felony arrests, about 6% of the arrestees were listed under "Other." There was no data on convictions or arrests of Asians even though they make up a large percentage of the population in the state.</p>
    
    <h2>Colorado</h2>
    <p>CO Rev Stat §16-23-103 (2016) requires DNA submission for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor conviction and any felony arrest. Prison admission data was used for convictions from the 2015 Statistical Report of the Colorado Department of Corrections.<span class="footnote">11</span> Felony arrests were found from the Report attached to enactment of the Community Law Enforcement Action Reporting Act.<span class="footnote">12</span></p>

    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> Sex crime misdemeanor convictions could not be found. Prison admission data was used due to difficulty in finding conviction data.</p>
    
    <h2>Connecticut</h2>
    <p>CT Gen Stat §54-102g (2012) requires DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions, and those arrested for serious felonies who had prior felony convictions. Prison admissions from 2015 were used in lieu of felony convictions, along with the present prison racial makeup to estimate the racial makeup of the admissions.<span class="footnote">13</span> No data was found for felony arrests for prior convicts.</p>
    
    <p><span class="footnote">13</span> https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p14.pdf p.10; https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/CT.html</p>
    
    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> There was no disclosed data on arrestees who had prior convictions. Prison admission data had to be used in lieu of conviction data.</p>
    
    <h2>Delaware</h2>
    <p>29 DE Code §4713 (2017) require DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions. Prison admissions from 2015 was used instead of convictions.<span class="footnote">14</span></p>

    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> Prison admissions data was used in lieu of convictions. There was no data specifically for sex crime misdemeanor convictions.</p>
    
    <h2>Florida</h2>
    <p>FL Stat §943.325 (2016) requires DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions. It also requires DNA submissions for convictions for stalking, voyeurism, acts concerning obscene materials, and gang-related offenses. DNA submissions are also required for felony arrests. Prison admissions data from 2015 is used in lieu of felony convictions, along with the prison population current racial makeup.<span class="footnote">15</span> Arrest data for 2015 was found in the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Arrest Data.<span class="footnote">16</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="footnote">15</span> http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1415/FDC_AR2014-15.pdf p.27; https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/FL.html<br>
    <span class="footnote">16</span> http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Data-Statistics/UCR-Arrest-Data.aspx (Arrests by Jurisdiction, Offense Type, and Race 2015)</p>
    
    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> The Florida statute requires DNA submissions for enumerated misdemeanor convictions, of which there is no specific data for. These cannot be assumed to be included in the prison admissions data as many of these misdemeanors would likely not lead to prison time. For felony convictions, prison admission data had to be used instead. The document providing prison admission data used white, black, and other to differentiate the newly admitted. Since there is a large population of Hispanics in Florida, the current prison population racial makeup from the Prison Policy Initiative was used instead to include Hispanics in the data. The arrest data also does not include Hispanic as a category.</p>
    
    <h2>Georgia</h2>
    <p>GA Code §35-3-160 (2014) requires DNA submissions for all felony convictions. Prison admissions data for 2016 was used in lieu of felony convictions.<span class="footnote">17</span></p>

    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> There was a lack of actual conviction data.</p>
    
    <h2>Hawaii</h2>
    <p>HI Rev Stat §844D-31, 39 (2011) requires DNA submissions for felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions. Prison admission data from 2015 was used instead of convictions.<span class="footnote">18</span> To determine the racial makeup, multiple sources were required to get the most accurate picture. The Disparate Treatment of Native Hawaiians in the Criminal Justice System provided the racial distribution in 2009 for Hawaiians, Asians, Whites, and Others.<span class="footnote">19</span> However, because the others category was 21.9%, we also used the Prison Policy Initiative data to pull out the percentage of blacks and Hispanics from others.<span class="footnote">20</span> This still left the category of others as 13.9%.</p>

    <p><strong>Difficulties:</strong> Prison admissions data was used over convictions. Sex crime misdemeanor convictions data was not available. The category of others still included 13.9% whose race is not specified.</p>
    
    <h2>Idaho</h2>
    <p>ID Code §19-5506 (2016) requires DNA submissions for all felony convictions. Prison admissions data from 2014 is used in lieu of convictions, along with the current racial makeup of the prison population.<span class="footnote">21</span></p>

    <h2>Illinois</h2>
    <p>730 ILCS §5/5-4-3 (2013) requires DNA submissions for all felony and sex crime misdemeanor convictions and for arrests for first degree murder, home invasion, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, aggravated criminal sexual assault, or criminal sexual assault. However, for arrests, expungement of the DNA is automatic if the arrestee is not convicted. Thus, arrest data is not necessary for our estimates. Prison admission data from 2013 was used in lieu of convictions.<span class="footnote">22</span></p>
