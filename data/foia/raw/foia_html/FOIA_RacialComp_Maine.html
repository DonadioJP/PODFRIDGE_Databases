        <p>Attn: Crime Lab<br>
        Maine State Police<br>

        45 Commerce Drive<br>
        Augusta, Maine 04333-0042</p>

        <p>To the Maine State Police Crime Lab:</p>

        <p>Pursuant to the Maine Freedom of Access Act ยง 402 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that provide the demographic characteristics of your state level (SDIS) DNA database. Specifically, I am seeking a snapshot in time of: 1) the total number of DNA profiles held in the convicted offender and arrested offender databases; 2) the percentage or number of those profiles that belong to females versus males; 3) the percentage or number of those profiles that fall within specific racial and ethnic categories, in terms of the major racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Caucasian/White, African-American/Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.). I do not seek any personally identifying or individualized information; I only want an aggregate statistic. I also recognize that the composition of the database may change day-to-day, which is why I ask only for a recent snapshot at any moment in time (ideally within the last year). Finally, I prefer to receive the information according to the categories described (convicted offender and arrestee) but will accept data that combines those groups.</p>

        <p>If there are any fees for searching or providing these records, then I request a waiver of all fees for this request since the disclosure of the information I seek is not primarily in my commercial interest and is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, making the disclosure a matter of public interest.</p>

        <p>Should you deny my request, or any part of the request, please state in writing the basis for the denial, including the exact statutory citation authorizing the denial.</p>

        <p>I will contact your office to discuss when I may expect fulfillment of my request, and payment of any statutorily prescribed fees. If you have any questions in the interim, you may contact me at 212-998-6672 or <a href="mailto:erin.murphy@nyu.edu">erin.murphy@nyu.edu</a>.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <p>Erin Murphy</p>
